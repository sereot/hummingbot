# Session Notes: 2025-01-23 - VALR WebSocket Timing Fix

## Objective
Fix the 10-second delay between order cycles in the VALR WebSocket connector that was preventing HFT strategies from achieving the configured 1-second refresh rate.

## Context
User reported that despite setting `order_refresh_time` to 1 second in their pure market making strategy configuration, orders were only being refreshed every 10 seconds.

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Analyzed VALR WebSocket connector for hardcoded delays and timeout values
- [x] Identified root cause: hardcoded 10-second intervals in VALR constants
- [x] Updated UPDATE_ORDER_STATUS_INTERVAL from 10.0 to 1.0 in valr_constants.py
- [x] Updated UPDATE_ORDER_STATUS_MIN_INTERVAL from 10.0 to 1.0 in valr_exchange.py
- [x] Added HFT-optimized poll intervals to VALR exchange class

## Technical Decisions Made
1. **Reduced Status Update Intervals**: Changed from 10 seconds to 1 second to match HFT requirements
2. **Optimized Poll Intervals**: Added override poll intervals for HFT:
   - SHORT_POLL_INTERVAL: 1.0 seconds (down from 5.0)
   - LONG_POLL_INTERVAL: 10.0 seconds (down from 120.0)
3. **Preserved Backward Compatibility**: Changes only affect timing, not functionality

## Files Modified/Created
- `/hummingbot/connector/exchange/valr/valr_constants.py`: Updated UPDATE_ORDER_STATUS_INTERVAL
- `/hummingbot/connector/exchange/valr/valr_exchange.py`: Updated UPDATE_ORDER_STATUS_MIN_INTERVAL and added poll interval overrides
- `/docs/sessions/2025-01-23-valr-timing-fix.md`: Created session documentation

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by two hardcoded constants that were forcing a minimum 10-second interval between order status updates:

1. `UPDATE_ORDER_STATUS_INTERVAL = 10.0` in valr_constants.py
2. `UPDATE_ORDER_STATUS_MIN_INTERVAL = 10.0` in valr_exchange.py

These values were overriding the strategy's configured `order_refresh_time` of 1 second, causing the 10-second delay.

## How the Fix Works
- The Clock component ticks every 1 second (default)
- The exchange connector's status polling mechanism now respects the 1-second intervals
- Orders can now be refreshed as frequently as configured in the strategy

## Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Test the fix with a live HFT strategy to confirm 1-second refresh rate
2. Monitor performance metrics to ensure no rate limit issues
3. Consider further optimizations if needed for sub-second refresh rates

## Code Quality Metrics
- Lines modified: 6
- Files changed: 2
- Test coverage: Pending verification with live testing

## Git Operations Completed
- Changes staged and ready for commit
- Commit message: "fix: reduce VALR order status update intervals from 10s to 1s for HFT"

## Session Success Metrics
- Root cause identified and fixed
- HFT performance requirement addressed
- Documentation created for future reference

## Notes for Next Session
- Monitor VALR rate limits during testing - current limits should support 1-second polling
- Consider implementing adaptive polling based on market volatility
- May need to optimize WebSocket message handling for even lower latency
