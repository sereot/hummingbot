# Session Notes: 2025-07-23 - Test Credentials Repository Sync

## Objective
Add VALR test API credentials to the repository for easier development setup and update documentation accordingly.

## Context
Following up from the comprehensive VALR WebSocket fix session. User requested syncing test API credentials to the repository since they are test-only credentials with no security risk, making it easier to set up development on new machines.

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Modified `.gitignore` to allow tracking `test_credentials.txt`
- [x] Added `test_credentials.txt` to git tracking
- [x] Updated `docs/DEV_SETUP_NEW_MACHINE.md` to reflect test credentials availability
- [x] Committed and pushed all changes to remote repository

## Technical Decisions Made
1. **Security Consideration**: Confirmed these are test-only credentials with limited permissions
2. **Documentation Updates**: Made clear distinction between test and production credentials
3. **Git Exception**: Added specific exception in .gitignore for test_credentials.txt while maintaining general credential exclusion

## Files Modified/Created
1. **`.gitignore`**
   - Added exception: `!test_credentials.txt` to allow tracking test credentials
   
2. **`test_credentials.txt`**
   - Added to repository with test API credentials
   - Contains API key and secret for VALR test account
   
3. **`docs/DEV_SETUP_NEW_MACHINE.md`**
   - Updated Section 4: Added note about test credentials being in repository
   - Updated Section 7: Added test credentials section with actual values
   - Updated Section 11: Clarified test_credentials.txt is included in repository

## Git Operations Completed
- Commit: `4f3b06e73` - "feat: add test API credentials to repository for easier development setup"
- Pushed to origin/master

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Simplified Setup**: New developers can immediately test VALR connector
2. **Consistent Testing**: Everyone uses same test credentials
3. **Reduced Friction**: No need to manually transfer test credentials
4. **Clear Documentation**: Distinction between test and production credentials

## Security Notes
- Test credentials have VIEW-ONLY permissions
- Cannot execute trades or access funds
- Safe for repository inclusion
- Production credentials must never be committed

## Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Monitor usage of test credentials across team
2. Consider adding more test accounts for other exchanges
3. Update other documentation to reference test credentials availability
4. Consider automated testing using these credentials

## Session Success Metrics
✅ Test credentials successfully added to repository
✅ Documentation updated with clear instructions
✅ Git history shows proper attribution
✅ Ready for seamless development setup on new machines

## Notes for Next Session
The development environment is now easier to set up on new machines. Test credentials are available directly from the repository, eliminating one manual step in the setup process.
