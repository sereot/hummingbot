# Session Notes: 2025-07-23 - Critical VALR Order Cancellation Fix

## Objective
Fix critical issue where VALR connector was not cancelling orders properly, causing unlimited order accumulation and preventing proper pure market making strategy operation.

## Context
Continuation from previous session where we fixed:
- WebSocket message format issues (CANCEL_LIMIT_ORDER)
- 10-second polling delays (LONG_POLL_INTERVAL)
- Initial order accumulation issues

## Problem Statement
User reported: "Now the strategy does not cancel orders at all and just keeps placing more new ones."

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Race Condition
The OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE handler introduced in the previous session was causing a critical race condition:

1. **Order Placement**: Strategy places order via WebSocket at time T
2. **Race Window**: OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE arrives at T+0.1s before order appears in exchange list
3. **False Cancellation**: Handler marks order as cancelled because it's not in the list
4. **Broken State**: Order is active on exchange but marked cancelled locally
5. **Failed Cancellation**: Strategy can't cancel because order is already "cancelled"
6. **Accumulation**: Orders keep accumulating without being cancelled

### Evidence from Logs
```
16:07:29,071 - Order HBOTSDEUT63a993aabaf9e717c13ae60693a not found in exchange open orders - marking as cancelled
16:07:29,076 - Order placed successfully via WebSocket: 0198379c-5d70-7ddf-b4f7-a490aab443d8
```
Same order marked as cancelled BEFORE it was successfully placed!

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Analyzed logs to identify race condition pattern
- [x] Added debug logging to track order age calculations
- [x] Discovered OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE handler was the root cause
- [x] Disabled the problematic handler to fix the issue
- [x] Committed and pushed the fix

## Technical Solution

### Immediate Fix
Disabled the OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE handler:
```python
elif event_type == CONSTANTS.WS_USER_OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE_EVENT:
    # DISABLED: This handler was causing race conditions with order cancellations
    # await self._process_open_orders_update(event_message)
    pass
```

### Why This Works
- Removes the race condition entirely
- Relies on existing ORDER_STATUS_UPDATE messages for order state
- WebSocket cancel confirmations work correctly
- Strategy can properly track and cancel its orders

## Files Modified
1. **`valr_exchange.py`**
   - Disabled `_process_open_orders_update()` handler call
   - Added debug logging for order age tracking
   - Added logging for exchange order IDs

## Verification Steps for User
1. Start conf_8 strategy again
2. Observe orders being placed and cancelled every 1 second
3. Verify only 2 orders active at any time (1 bid, 1 ask)
4. Check logs for successful WebSocket cancellations
5. Monitor for any "order not found" errors

## Future Improvements
1. **Proper Order Sync**: Implement OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE with proper timing
   - Wait for order confirmation before processing
   - Use exchange timestamps instead of local time
   - Implement proper state machine for order lifecycle

2. **Message Ordering**: Handle WebSocket message race conditions
   - Queue OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE messages
   - Process after ORDER_PROCESSED confirmations
   - Use sequence numbers if available

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track cancellation success rates

## Lessons Learned
1. **Race Conditions**: WebSocket messages can arrive out of order
2. **State Synchronization**: Local and exchange state must be carefully managed
3. **Testing**: Need comprehensive testing for high-frequency scenarios
4. **Logging**: Debug logging crucial for identifying timing issues

## Git Operations Completed
- Commit: `25157a9e0` - "fix: disable OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE handler causing order cancellation race conditions"
- Pushed to origin/master

## Session Success Metrics
✅ Identified root cause of order accumulation
✅ Implemented immediate fix to restore functionality
✅ Preserved HFT performance (1-second cycles)
✅ Maintained WebSocket efficiency
✅ Clear path forward for proper implementation

## Notes for Next Session
1. Monitor user feedback on fix effectiveness
2. Consider implementing proper OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE with timing controls
3. Add performance metrics for order cancellation success rate
4. Investigate ORDER_PROCESSED message routing (still pending)

The VALR connector should now properly cancel orders in the pure market making strategy!
