### 🛠️ What Was Set Up

#### Repository Structure
```
hummingbot/                 # Main Hummingbot codebase
├── hummingbot/            # Core Python package
├── custom_strategies/     # Your custom strategies
├── custom_connectors/     # Your custom connectors  
├── custom_scripts/        # Development scripts

├── sync_upstream.sh      # Sync with upstream repo
├── start_dev.sh          # Development environment starter
└── test_installation.py  # Installation test script
```

#### Development Scripts Created
- `sync_upstream.sh` - Sync with upstream Hummingbot repository
- `start_dev.sh` - Start development environment
- `test_installation.py` - Test installation

#### Git Remotes Configured
- `origin`: https://github.com/sereot/hummingbot.git (your fork)
- `upstream`: https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git (official repo)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Start Development (Recommended Path)

Since the CLI has some dependency conflicts, focus on **programmatic development** first:

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate hummingbot

# Import and work with Hummingbot components
python -c "
from hummingbot.strategy.pure_market_making import PureMarketMakingStrategy
from hummingbot.core.data_type.order_book import OrderBook
print('✅ Ready for development!')
"
```

### 2. Study Existing Code

```bash
# Explore strategies
ls hummingbot/strategy/

# Look at pure market making strategy
cat hummingbot/strategy/pure_market_making/pure_market_making.py

# Study connector implementations
ls hummingbot/connector/exchange/
```

### 3. Create Your First Custom Strategy

Follow the roadmap in `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` to create your first strategy.

### 4. Fix CLI Issues (Advanced)

If you want to fix the CLI startup issues:

1. **Pydantic compatibility**: The issue is commlib-py requires pydantic v1 but Hummingbot needs v2
2. **Solution**: Consider using Docker or create a compatible environment

## 📋 Development Commands

```bash
# Essential commands
conda activate hummingbot          # Activate environment
./compile                         # Recompile after changes
python test_installation.py       # Test core functionality
./sync_upstream.sh               # Sync with upstream

# Code quality
black .                          # Format code
flake8 .                        # Lint code
pytest tests/                   # Run tests

# Git workflow
git checkout -b feature/my-feature  # Create feature branch
git add . && git commit -m "feat: my change"
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

# Test core imports
python -c "import hummingbot; print('✅ Working')"
```

### Git Issues
```bash
# Check remotes
git remote -v

# Sync with upstream
./sync_upstream.sh

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current
```

### Compilation Issues
```bash
# Clean and recompile
rm -rf build/
./compile
```
